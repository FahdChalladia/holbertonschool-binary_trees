# C - Binary trees

This repository contains several tasks demonstrating the implementation and manipulation of binary trees in C. It covers node operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and memory management, providing a hands-on understanding of dynamic data structures with binary relationships.

### Files

Each task is implemented in its own C file, focusing on a specific operation on a `binary_tree_s` structure.
