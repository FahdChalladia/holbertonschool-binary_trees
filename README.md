# C - Binary trees

This repository contains several tasks demonstrating the implementation and manipulation of binary trees in C. It covers node operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and memory management, providing a hands-on understanding of dynamic data structures with binary relationships.

### Files

Each task is implemented in its own C file, focusing on a specific operation on a `binary_tree_s` structure.

- `0-binary_tree_node.c` :
  Function that creates a binary tree node.
- `2-binary_tree_insert_right.c` 
  Function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node.
